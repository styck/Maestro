Director Prompt Polish — applies model-specific prompt optimization to Director output.

Three modes:
  - full_guide:   Inject the full enhance guide into the planner's system prompt
  - light_guide:  Inject a lightweight dialect cheat sheet into the planner's system prompt
  - third_pass:   Run each prompt through the enhance pipeline after planning

The setting is stored as `director_prompt_polish` in services config.

# ── Image Prompt Sanitization (Layer 1) ──────────────────────────────────
# Deterministic post-process for Pass 2 image_prompts and Pass 3 image
# polish output. Catches violations of rules in image_prompt_rules_*.md
# that the LLM consistently drops on NSFW content. Three passes:
#
#   1. Garment stripper: enforces the GARMENT BAN (#1 rule). Replaces
#      "[color] [garment]" with just "[color]" so the image model
#      preserves whatever the reference shows. Skips modifiers like
#      "removed"/"torn"/"unbuttoned" because those signal the garment
#      is being acted on (which the rule says IS allowed).
#
#   2. Narrative-filler stripper: removes phrases like "showing the
#      heat of the moment" that are emotion/narrative, not physical
#      mechanics. The image model can't render these and they waste
#      the prompt's attention budget.
#
#   3. Duplicate-descriptor dedupe (Pass 3 only — needs name_to_desc
#      map): when the same descriptor appears 2+ times, the 2nd+
#      occurrences become pronouns. Pass 3's LLM commonly does this
#      when it re-emphasizes character identity and ends up saying
#      "the woman in the white sweater on the left with red hair"
#      twice in 30 words.
#
# NOTE: deliberately does NOT strip embellishment trigger phrases
# (LoRA-specific descriptors). Those are sometimes legitimate
# LoRA invocations — Pass 3 sees LoRA hints intentionally and may
# invoke them on purpose. Banning would break valid LoRA usage.

        Why: the previous static block listed every known character even

        entries like "Blaine → strong man in black", interpreted the
        arrow as bidirectional, and "promoted" descriptors back to
        names the input never had ("the strong man in black" became
        "The Blaine"). Filtering eliminates the inciting condition —
        if the polish LLM has no name to insert, it can't insert one.

        Wording is also strengthened: explicit ONE-WAY arrow, explicit
        DO-NOT-REVERSE rule, replace verb in imperative form. The
        previous wording ("when the prompt contains any of these names
        ... replace the name with the matching descriptor") was
        ambiguous enough that smaller LLMs treated it as bidirectional.

        Returns empty string when no names appear in input or the map
        is empty — in that case the system prompt has zero character
        guidance and the polish LLM cannot invent names.

    #   'You know, it's ridiculous how much you've been on my mind.'

    # (BEFORE: 3 spurious spans, AFTER: 1 real span) caused
    # _revert_modified_dialogue to skip the revert entirely and the
    # mangled dialogue ("Cathy" → "woman in white with massive breasts")
    # passed through untouched.
    #
    # Fix: separate single- and double-quote regexes. Single-quote spans
    # require word-boundary lookbehind/lookahead so contraction
    # apostrophes (which are flanked by letters on BOTH sides) are
    # never mistaken for span boundaries. Double-quote spans are

        Any quoted span whose contents differ from the input gets reverted
        to the input's original text.

        Defensive complement to _normalize_names_descriptors. That function
        only reverts known descriptor→name substitutions inside quotes; it
        can't catch when the polish LLM hallucinates a NEW descriptor
        ("woman in middle with massive breasts") that isn't in our map at
        all. This function reverts ANY modification to quoted text — the
        polish layer has no business changing dialogue, period.

        Conservative on edge cases:
        - If quote counts differ between before and after (polish added or
          removed a quoted span), returns the polished text unchanged
          rather than risk a misalignment that mangles output. The
          mismatch is logged so we can investigate.
        - Quote characters from the input are preserved (straight " vs '
          stay the way the screenplay author wrote them).
        - Empty quotes are skipped to avoid replacing intentional speech
          beats with empty strings.

        Uses _iter_quoted_spans which is contraction-aware — the previous
        regex split single-quoted dialogue containing apostrophes
        ("it's", "you've") into multiple fake spans, causing this revert
        to silently bail on count mismatch. Real-world impact: dialogue
        like "Cathy" being mangled to descriptor inside quotes was
